      <p>Two years ago we had our School Debate contest and our school won the first round and now it was time for the
        final round. The topic given was ‘Environment
        pollution’ and the students were really excited . The judges were from ABC Technical
        College, and the BCD University and they looked very stern and strict.
        Our school started off well as it had most of the ‘brain boxes’ of our school. Everyone contributed equally to
        the
        debate. In the end, when the judges announce the winner, we were overjoyed! The judges commented that though the
        Lotus Valley school fought well, it was the Mayoor school which had knowledge and fluency on its side!</p>
